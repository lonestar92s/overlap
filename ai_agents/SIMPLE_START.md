## Visual Example

Here's exactly what you'll see:

│ You are a Design Engineer for React Native...  │
│ [all the text from uiux_agent.md]              │
│                                                 │

## Try It Right Now!

**I'll give you the exact steps:**

1. **Open this file:** `ai_agents/uiux_agent.md`
2. **Select all** (Cmd+A) and **copy** (Cmd+C)
3. **Open chat** (Cmd+L)
4. **Paste** (Cmd+V)
5. **Type:** `@MatchCard.js` and select it
6. **Type:** `Review this component`
7. **Press Enter**

The agent will tell you:
- ✅ What's good
- ⚠️ What needs fixing
- 💡 How to fix it (with code!)

---

## What If Something Doesn't Work?

### "I don't see @ working"
Try this instead:
1. In chat, click the **paperclip icon** or **attachment button**
2. Navigate to: `mobile-app/components/MatchCard.js`
3. Select it

### "I can't find the chat"
- Press `Cmd+L` (Mac) or `Ctrl+L` (Windows)
- Or look for a chat/message icon in Cursor's toolbar

### "The agent didn't respond"
- Make sure you pasted the FULL content from `uiux_agent.md`
- Make sure you attached a file
- Try asking again: "Can you review this component?"

---

## After You Get the Review

The agent will give you feedback like:

```
Found issues:
1. Line 331: Hardcoded borderRadius: 12
   Should use: borderRadius.md from designTokens

2. Line 334: Hardcoded padding: 16
   Should use: spacing.md from designTokens

Here's the fixed code...
```

Then you:
1. Read the issues
2. Apply the fixes (the agent gives you the code!)
3. Ask: "Have I fixed everything?" to double-check

---

## Other Agents Work the Same Way!

**Architect Agent:**
1. Copy `architect_agent.md`
2. Paste in chat
3. Attach a file/folder
4. Ask: "Review this for architecture"

**QA Agent:**
1. Copy `qa_agent.md`
2. Paste in chat
3. Attach a component
4. Ask: "Write tests for this"

**DevOps Agent:**
1. Copy `devops_agent.md`
2. Paste in chat
3. Attach: `app.json`, `eas.json`
4. Ask: "Check production readiness"

---

## Still Stuck?

**Simplest possible version:**

Just paste THIS into Cursor chat:
```
You are a Design Engineer. Review the attached React Native component for design consistency and accessibility. Check if it uses designTokens.js instead of inline styles.
```

Then attach `MatchCard.js` and ask: "Review this"

That's it! No need for the full agent file if you want to start simple.

## You've Got This! 🚀

Remember:
- Copy agent file → Paste in chat → Attach file → Ask for review
- That's the pattern for every agent
- Start simple, then you'll get faster at it

Try it now with MatchCard.js! It only takes 30 seconds.
